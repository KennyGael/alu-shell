# Shell, Processes and Signals

This project is part of the ALU Shell curriculum.

It includes Bash scripts demonstrating how to work with:
- Process IDs (PIDs)
- Parent processes
- Signals like SIGINT and SIGTERM
- Background and foreground jobs

Each script is written in Bash, uses proper shebang, is Shellcheck-compliant, and ends with a new line.
